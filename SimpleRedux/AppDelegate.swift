// To maintain our state and delegate the actions to the reducers,
// we need a store. Let's call it mainStore and define it as a global
// constant, for example in the app delegate file:
// Note: middlewares are optional
let store = Store(reducer: appReducer, state: AppState(), middleware: [])

        // This can occur for certain types of temporary interruptions (such as an
        // incoming phone call or SMS message) or when the user quits the application
        // and it begins the transition to the background state.
        // Use this method to pause ongoing tasks, disable timers, and invalidate
        // graphics rendering callbacks. Games should use this method to pause the game.

        // and store enough application state information to restore your application to its
        // current state in case it is terminated later.
        // If your application supports background execution, this method is called instead of
        // applicationWillTerminate: when the user quits.
